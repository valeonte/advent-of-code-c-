# Advent of Code Solutions in C#

I found out about Advent of Code shortly before its 2018 countdown started so I decided 
to go for it - not learning any new languages or anything, just using what I already know to finish it 
without spending too much time (supposedly).

## Disclaimers

The code you will find in here may not be optimal or may be full of bugs! It is just the first thing that came
to my mind and worked to provide the correct solution.
